    "- Optimization solvers such as ipopt -- ```conda install -c conda-forge ipopt``` (Note: you may have to debug this, I had to debug a bit on Ubuntu but directions are platform specific). You can install this without Anaconda, but it is extremely complicated. Using conda is **strongly** recommended. \n",

While academic and commercial solvers do exist that are mathematically guaranteed to find the global solution of a nonlinear programming problem, large problems cannot be solved by state-of-the-art solvers.

You'll note that the solver at the end of the workshop gets hung up on a local solution, but ultimately you will need to decide whether or not the local solution makes sense, or whether it is likely to be the global solution -- the solver will not give you this guidance."

While messing around with constraints, you may also be tempted to relax the constraint ```model.a_fix```, which will yield a lower objective function -- but notice that doing this yields variable solutions that we do not want, as the solver will simply choose very small values of $A$ in order to minimize the objective function.

Often times you will need to restart the algorithm using the solution values reached by a prior run, which can be done simply by running ```opt.solve(instance)``` without redefining the instance. As such, be prepared that you will need to run the code block below potentially several times.

    "In this case, we are able to solve for close to optimal solution values. However, some models will be difficult to solve using the \"IPOpt\" solver (a free, non-linear solver), and sometimes commercial solvers are much, much better at finding solutions to particular types of large problems. You can use fast commercial solvers instead (such as Cplex, Gurobi, and Knitro), but they are not free. I haven't figured out how to get these locally without paying, but we have an institutional subscription to GAMS that can be run on the ARE server, which includes (demos to some of) these and many more commercial solvers. Pyomo allows you to write your problem as a script readable by GAMS, which allows for use of its more powerful solvers (without having to code in GAMS). Be aware that many solvers require you to start with a small value of your objective function, so you may need to either scale down your variables and/or objective function by a constant, or solve it first locally and then export the problem later. Solvers may also require variable boundaries that others do not. To do so, run:"
